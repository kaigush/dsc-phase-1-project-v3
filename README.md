# ✈️ Aviation Accident Risk Analysis

## 📘 Overview
This project analyzes global aviation accident data to identify aircraft types, models, and operational conditions associated with the lowest risk of accidents.  
The findings aim to guide the aviation division in improving air safety, optimizing fleet selection, and supporting data-driven decisions.

---

## 🎯 Business Understanding
The goal of this project is to advise the head of the new aviation division on which aircraft have the lowest accident potential.  
Through data cleaning, exploration, and visualization, the analysis highlights accident patterns by aircraft make, model, engine type, weather, and flight phase.

## 🧩 Data Understanding
- **Dataset Size:** 90,348 records, 31 columns  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Aircraft make and model  
  - Engine type and number of engines  
  - Weather conditions and phase of flight  
  - Severity and damage level  
- **Data Cleaning Process:**  
  - Removed 1,390 duplicates  
  - Dropped irrelevant and high-missing-value columns  
  - Imputed missing numerical values  
  - Removed incomplete categorical rows

## 📊 Data Analysis Highlights
- **Investigation Types:** 98.4% accidents vs. 1.6% incidents  
- **Aircraft Damage:** 73.6% destroyed, 24% substantial, 2.4% minor  
- **Amateur Built:** 90.1% non–amateur-built aircraft  
- **Weather Conditions:** 92% of accidents occurred under VMC (good weather)  
- **Engine Type:** Reciprocating engines had the highest accident rates  
- **Flight Phases:** Most accidents occurred during landing, takeoff, and approach  
- **Aircraft Makes with Most Accidents:** Cessna, Piper, Beech, Bell  
- **Safer Models Identified:** 150M, PA-28-180, PA-18

## 💡 Recommendations
1. **Safer Aircraft Makes:** Boeing, Hughes, Bellanca, Robinson, Grumman, Mooney  
2. **Low-Risk Models:** 150M, PA-28-180, PA-18  
3. **Enhanced Pilot Training:** Focus on critical flight phases (landing, takeoff, maneuvering)  
4. **Weather Awareness:** Maintain caution even in good (VMC) weather conditions

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Develop predictive models to assess accident risk probabilities  
- Integrate pilot experience and maintenance data for deeper insights  
- Build real-time safety dashboards for continuous monitoring
